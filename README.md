# Nuxt 3 Control Panel Application

[Russian version](README.ru.md)

This is a Nuxt 3 based frontend project that serves as the control panel for a live streaming service. The project is currently in a beta version and the codebase could benefit from some refactoring, but it is actively being used in a production environment.
The project utilizes the Nuxt.js framework, which is built on top of Vue.js, to provide a modern and efficient user interface. It includes several key features and integrations:

- Theming and Color Mode: The application supports both light and dark color modes, with the ability to automatically switch based on user preferences.
- Authentication: The project integrates with a backend API built on Laravel using the Sanctum authentication library. This allows users to log in, log out, and access protected user-specific data.
- Pusher Integration: The application uses the Pusher real-time communication platform to provide real-time updates and notifications to users.
- Charting and Visualization: The project includes several charts and data visualizations powered by the Chart.js library, which are used to display streaming analytics and performance metrics.
- Table, Image, and Text Editing: The application includes advanced text editing capabilities using the Tiptap WYSIWYG editor, as well as support for tables and image uploads.

Although the codebase could benefit from some refactoring and optimization, this project demonstrates my ability to work with modern web technologies, integrate with backend APIs, and build complex user interfaces for a live streaming platform. I'm continuously improving the project and learning new techniques to make it more robust and maintainable.
